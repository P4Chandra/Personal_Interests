# Personal_Interests
Some of my Personal Projects that aided me in learning and understanding concepts. Will try to catalog as many as possible here.
These projects start with Basic Levels and progesses through Intermediate and then advanced.
I have tried projects at several levels of proficiency through Udacity Programs, that always had  starter codes to assist. However the projects listed below are from scratch and would help me while I progress to advance stages.

## Personal Projects : Beginner Level

### Kaggle Titanic Prediction
I have made couple of submissions using  classic ML models i.e Decision Tree and Random Forrest. The resultant highest accuracy in kaggle that I could get is 0.63397.

Some improvements that I could think about, better algorithm to determine missing data for "Age", "Fare", "SibSp","Parch","Embarked".
Other  option is to try normalizing the numerical coloumn to see if that would increase accuracy.
